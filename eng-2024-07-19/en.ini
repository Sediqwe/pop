CropDisease_AsterYellows=Aster Yellows
CropDisease_AsterYellows_Desc=An insect-borne disease that causes stunted growth and significant yield loss, especially in carrots and cabbage. Long rotations are beneficial but it is often best to destroy infected crops.
CropDisease_BeanBrownSpot=Bean Brown Spot
CropDisease_BeanBrownSpot_Desc=Brown Spot often appears in the autumn after cool weather or hard rains. It damages leaves and causes stunted, malformed beans. A 2-3 year crop rotation and avoiding late plantings can minimize chances of brown spot.
CropDisease_BeanWilt=Bean Wilt
CropDisease_BeanWilt_Desc=A fungal disease that lives in the soil and affects bean and pea crops. Plants become yellow and wilted, then eventually die. Crop loss is moderate and the disease is most active in hot weather. It can be controlled by rotating with resistant crops.
CropDisease_Clubroot=Clubroot
CropDisease_Clubroot_Desc=Clubroot is a tenacious fungal disease that can accumulate in the soil and attacks turnips and cabbage. It causes moderate crop loss. Managed with crop rotation, it dissipates slowly and may require turnips, cabbages and other plants in that family not to be grown in the affected field for several years. It has only a low chance of spreading to immediately adjacent fields. 
CropDisease_FlaxRust=Flax Rust
CropDisease_FlaxRust_Desc=Flax Rust is carried by the wind and can grow out of control quickly, with the potential to wipe out entire crops. It spreads easily and far to other flax fields if not stopped quickly. Flax Rust declines quickly in magnitude if the field is left fallow or other crop types are planted.
CropDisease_FlaxWilt=Flax Wilt
CropDisease_FlaxWilt_Desc=Flax Wilt begins in the roots, traveling up the plant and causing significant yield loss. It can accumulate quickly but has only a low chance to spread to nearby fields as it is borne by seeds and soil. It may take multiple years to abate with rotation.
CropDisease_LeekBlight=Leek Blight
CropDisease_LeekBlight_Desc=A fungal disease that causes white blotches and wilting of leaves. It appears in warm weather but, due to the long growing season of leeks, it can only really be mitagated through crop rotation.
CropDisease_PinkRoot=Pink Root Rot
CropDisease_PinkRoot_Desc=A pink-hued infection of the roots caused by soil-dwelling fungus that can accumulate in fields. Crop rotation can keep it from getting out of control but, even at high levels, it doesn't seriously impact leeks.
CropDisease_PowderyMildew=Powdery Mildew
CropDisease_PowderyMildew_Desc=First visible in the weeks following full bloom, Powdery Mildew colonizes the blossoms and leaves of beans, peas and buckwheat, leading to pale lesions which grow to become thick white mold. The spread of white mold can be slowed or eliminated by allowing the field to fallow or by planting less affected crops.
CropDisease_RootRot=Root Rot
CropDisease_RyeRust=Rye Rust
CropDisease_RyeRust_Desc=A fungal disease carried by the wind, that is particular to rye. It can grow out of control quickly unless rye crops are properly spaced. If the disease is severe, it may warrant destroying the crop.
CropDisease_StemRot=Stem Rot
CropDisease_StemRot_Desc=A soil-borne disease that affects buckwheat, beans and peas, causing stems to rot and girdling the plants. It is most active in cooler, moist weather. It can cause significant crop loss if not managed through rotation to other crops and remains in the soil for years.
CropDisease_TurnipLeafSpot=Turnip Leaf Spot
CropDisease_TurnipLeafSpot_Desc=Carried by the wind, this disease damages the leaves of the turnip plant and can cause moderate crop loss. It can spead to nearby turnip fields if not properly managed.
CropDisease_WheatBlotch=Wheat Leaf Blotch
CropDisease_WheatBlotch_Desc=Wheat Blotch is a wind-borne disease that can grow quickly in magnitude, spread easily and far and cause severe crop yield loss. Infection will decline quickly if other crops are rotated in or the field is left fallow. 
CropDisease_WheatRootknots=Wheat Root Knot
CropDisease_WheatRootknots_Desc=Wheat Root Knot is a parasitic disease that affects the root structure of wheat, resulting in stunted growth and reduced yield. Infection must be managed through crop rotation or leaving the fields fallow as the nematode eggs can survive for over a year.
CropDisease_WheatRust=Wheat Rust
CropDisease_WheatRust_Desc=Wheat Rust is carried by the wind and can grow out of control quickly, with the potential to wipe out entire crops. It spreads easily and far to other wheat fields if not stopped quickly. Wheat Rust declines quickly in magnitude if the field is left fallow or other crop types are planted.
CropDisease_YellowDwarfing=Yellow Dwarfing
CropDisease_YellowDwarfing_Desc=A disease common to many grains but particularly devastating to wheat. It stunts growth and can cause sterility, leading to less grain development. Rye is not as significantly damaged.
CropFieldPanel_Title=Crop Field
CropFieldPlant_Description_Beans=Bean crops yield moderate amounts of dried beans that can be stored longer than other crops. Beans are sensitive to frost. As a nitrogen fixing plant, beans can help improve soil fertility.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Buckwheat=Buckwheat yields grain, which must be milled into flour. Despite its name, it is not related to wheat or even a grass and so is not affected by diseases of other grains. Buckwheat does not typically yield as much grain as wheat or rye and is not frost tolerant, but it has a short growing period and does not need fertile soil.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Cabbage=Cabbage is a source of vegetable greens, which only have a moderate storage life. It is fairly frost tolerant, but requires fertile soil. Food yields are good.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Carrot=Carrots provide a moderate yield of root vegetables. They are frost tolerant and store well. Carrots do not require high soil fertility but do less well in rocky fields.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Clover=Can be grown to replenish soil fertility in a field.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Flax=Flax is used to make linen. Flax is not highly frost tolerant and requires adequate soil fertility.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Hay=Hay is grown solely as feed for animals, such as chickens, cows, goats, and horses.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Leek=Leeks produce vegetable greens, which only have a moderate storage life. Leeks have a long growing period and require good soil, but have a very high food yield and high frost tolerance.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Peas=Peas yield moderate amounts of food in the form of dried beans, which can be stored for longer than other crops. They are very frost tolerant and can contribute to soil fertility. Peas are best grown in early spring before diseases are most active.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Rye=Rye is a cereal crop similar to wheat that yields grain, which is milled into flour. Rye yields are not as high as wheat but it is less affected by lower fertility and diseases. Rye is also more frost tolerant than wheat.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Turnips=Turnips are a dependable crop with moderately high yield of root vegetables, which store well. Turnips grow very quickly, are frost tolerant, and do well even in average soil. Turnips tolerate disease better than most crops.
CropFieldPlant_Description_Wheat=Wheat produces grain that must be milled into flour and baked. Wheat has high food yields and grain can be stored longer than most crops. Wheat requires fertile soil and diseases can cause significant crop loss.

DiseaseDesc_BrokenBone=Villagers undertaking more hazardous jobs such as mining or labor in a work camp are prone to be injured on the job. Fractured bones can lead to improper healing and infection unless treated by a healer.
DiseaseDesc_BrokenLeg=Broken legs incapacitate villagers for a time. A healer can help ensure broken legs don't lead to infection or long-term disability. Making sure villagers are outfit with shoes can help reduce chances of breaking a leg.
DiseaseDesc_BubonicPlague=Harbored by rodents, the bubonic plague is a deadly disease that can be transmitted by fleas. If treatment fails, those afflicted may be left with permanent disability or die. To avoid plague outbreaks, limit rat populations by storing grain in granaries, improving food storage, collecting household waste and employing Rat Catchers if necessary.
DiseaseDesc_Cholera=Cholera is an infection spread through contaminated water that causes violent vomiting and diarrhea. Recovery chances are good if the afflicted are provided with clean water. Ensure villagers have access to wells and waste is removed from houses.
DiseaseDesc_Cold=The common cold is a mild seasonal illness that villagers can work through if provided with herbal remedies. Untreated, it has a small chance to progress to pneumonia.
DiseaseDesc_Consumption=Those who contract consumption are stricken with a fever, coughing and discharge from the lungs, leading to a gradual wasting and death if not treated. Converting milk into cheese will reduce infection chances.
DiseaseDesc_Dehydration=Dehydration is easily managed by a ready supply of drinking water, but can be fatal if prolonged. Build shelters near fresh water or wells.
DiseaseDesc_DisabilitySevere=Serious injury or disease that is not successfully treated can lead to long-term chronic illness, preventing villagers from working. Treatment by a healer and good nutrition can help some chronically ill villagers recover in time.
DiseaseDesc_DisabilityTemporary=A period of incapacitation can occur when serious injury or disease is not effectively treated. These villagers cannot work and may remain at home for months trying to recover. Treatment by a healer and a good diet can greatly speed recovery.
DiseaseDesc_Dysentery=Dysentery is an intestinal infection that can cause vomiting and diarrhea. Villagers left without clean water sources are susceptible to death from dehydration.
DiseaseDesc_EagleAttack=Sometimes eagles attack. When they do, its best to have a healer treat any wounds lest they become infected.
DiseaseDesc_Flu=Influenza is a moderate seasonal illness that can progress to pneumonia if left untreated. Villagers treated with herbs can continue working and have a good chance of recovery. Having open beds at a healer can help villagers recover while reducing the spread of the disease.
DiseaseDesc_FoodPoisoning=Food poisoning often arises from consuming raw or undercooked meat or fish. This can be avoided by providing firewood to cook with and smoking meat or fish. Food poisoning is not usually fatal but a healer can help ensure a fast recovery.
DiseaseDesc_FootWound=Foot wounds occur when villagers lack shoes and can result in tetanus if not properly treated.
DiseaseDesc_Frostbite=Tissue damage caused by prolonged exposure to cold. Coats, shoes, and ensuring firewood supply can help prevent frostbite and speed recovery.
DiseaseDesc_Gangrene=Gangrene is an infection of the tissue that can occur after damage from frostbite or an open wound. Reduce frostbite by providing coats, shoes, and firewood to villagers.
DiseaseDesc_Gout=Frequent beer consumption can lead to gout. Initially gout causes joint pain and stiffness but can progress to kidney failure. Happy villagers tend to drink less and a healer may help but typically gout flare ups will pass in time.
DiseaseDesc_Infection=Sepsis can occur when an open fracture or wound is left untreated and infection sets in. At this stage, it may be too late but a skilled healer can have some success in keeping the patient alive long enough for the body to fight off the infection.
DiseaseDesc_MushroomPoisoning=Many varieties of edible mushrooms have similar looking poisonous counterparts and occassionally, even an experieced forager can make a mistake. A healer with medicine can help but often mushroom poisoning is fatal.
DiseaseDesc_Pneumonia=An inflammatory condition of the lungs usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria. Pneumonia can be lethal if not treated.
DiseaseDesc_Rabies=A disease spread by a bite or scratch from an infected animal. Rabies, meaning "rage", affects the brain causing aggression, hallucinations, and eventually paralysis. It cannot be cured and is almost always fatal. Hide coats can protect villagers from bites, reducing the chance of contracting the disease.
DiseaseDesc_RatBiteFever=As the name implies, rat bite fever is spread by rat bites, scratches, or contact with droppings, causing fever, vomiting, and muscle ache. People often recover but, without treatment, recovery may be slow. Ensure villagers have shoes and keep rat populations low by collecting waste, storing grain in granaries, stocking barrels and employing Rat Catchers.
DiseaseDesc_Scurvy=Malnutrition caused by lack of ascorbic acid. Scurvy can be prevented and cured by supplying fruits and some vegetables.
DiseaseDesc_Tetanus=Infection introduced through a puncture wound. Tetanus is difficult to treat and best prevented by ensuring villagers have shoes.
DiseaseDesc_Worms=An infection with parasitic worms can lead to various symptoms including stomach pain, vomiting, fever, rashes, etc. Worms are spread by close contact or through bare feet. Ensure villagers have shoes, soap, clean water, and that waste is removed from houses. 
DiseaseDesc_Wound=Wounds received in combat or in certain professions may become infected and require treatment from a healer. Without a healer, herbs can help but the outcome may prove fatal. 
DiseaseDescription_Rabies=A deadly virus spread from the saliva of infected animals. Hide coats will help protect your villagers from animal bites. Destroying animal dens outside town can help keep predator populations in check.
DiseaseDescription_SmallPox=Small pox is a highly infectious disease that begins with fever, malaise and vomiting, then lesions cover the skin. Death rate is high. A healer can help contain the spread by isolating the infected.
DiseaseDescription_Typhoid=An infection that arises from uncleanliness and can then be spread among villagers. Typhoid causes vomiting, rash, fever, and can sometimes be fatal. Ensuring waste is collected from houses, houses are stocked with soap, and rat populations are kept low will reduce chances of a Typhoid outbreak.

A high desirability is a prerequisite for shelters to upgrade to higher tiers. As higher tier homes generate tax revenue, have increased occupancy, and are required for Town Center upgrades, this is very…desirable.
TutorialScreen_Desirability_02=     When selecting a building for placement from the Build UI, you can see whether it impacts desirability based on the chevrons next to its name. A green chevron means that the building will have a positive effect, while a red chevron indicates a negative effect. A yellow chevron indicates that the structure has no effect on desirability.
TutorialScreen_Desirability_03=     Once you are ready to place the building, moving the placement preview around the town will show the impact it will have on the desirability of nearby homes.[BR][BR]     Lowering a home’s desirability too much can cause it to become abandoned as the area no longer fulfills its desirability requirements.
TutorialScreen_Desirability_Title=Desirability
TutorialScreen_Fertility_01=     Crop field fertility has a major effect on crop harvests. If fertility gets too low, crops will produce very little food, which can lead to starvation.[BR]     Each crop planted will usually decrease the ground's fertility, but crops such as Peas and Clover can actually restore fertility to the soil. It is important to balance crop rotations so that fertility can be maintained.[BR]     Compost Yards are another useful tool for maintaining soil fertility, by applying the compost they generate to crop fields. Allowing cattle to graze on fields is another option, but note that the cows will eat any crops you plant.[BR]     Note that the environment fertility factor will reduce how effective crops and compost are at improving soil fertility.
TutorialScreen_Fertility_Title=Soil Fertility
TutorialScreen_Graveyard_01=Dead villagers left out to rot will attract vermin and disease.
TutorialScreen_Graveyard_02=Designate area to be used as graveyards to bury the dead and keep villagers happy and healthy.
TutorialScreen_Graveyard_Title=Bring out your dead!
TutorialScreen_HarvestResources_01=Resources like logs or stone must be marked for harvest before laborers will collect them. The harvest menu can be enabled by toggling the harvest button on the bottom right toolbar, or by pressing the '{0}' key.
TutorialScreen_HarvestResources_02=Once the menu is open, click and drag to select resources for harvest. Hold 'SHIFT' while clicking and dragging to deselect resources for harvest.
TutorialScreen_LaborShortage_01=     As your settlement grows and villagers begin to branch out into more specific professions, you may find yourself with a shortage of laborers to perform common tasks such as harvesting resources or clearing build sites.
TutorialScreen_LaborShortage_02=     The profession window is a useful tool to control the number of villagers you have in each occupation. You can increase the size of your labor pool by lowering the number of villagers you have in other professions.[BR]     Note that if the number of laborers is red, then your town may not have enough laborers to perform all the necessary tasks.
TutorialScreen_LaborShortage_Title=Labor Shortage!
TutorialScreen_MaxPopulation_01=Villagers require homes to be happy and healthy, and to provide shelter from the elements. As villagers immigrate to your town, you will need to construct more houses to meet the demand.  Villagers will automatically inhabit any available living space.
TutorialScreen_MaxPopulation_02=If there is no housing available, villagers will be exposed to the elements, and risk damage or even death from the cold.
TutorialScreen_MaxPopulation_03=As your settlement develops, you will need to continue to provide goods for villagers to stock in their homes, as well as construction materials for upgrading homes to higher tiers.
TutorialScreen_MaxPopulation_Title=Housing Shortage!
TutorialScreen_RallyFlags_01=     By pressing the Flag Combat Area button in the Barracks UI, you can quickly send all of your soldiers to defend an area.[BR]     Soldiers will remain there until the rally point has been moved, or they are sent back to the Barracks by selecting the rally point and issuing the command.[BR]     Each Barracks has its own rally point, so you can send your forces to different locations using this method if you have more than one Barracks.[BR][BR]     Note that soldiers will loyally remain in the designated location even if their needs are not met, so they can and will inevitably starve if left on duty for too long.
TutorialScreen_RallyFlags_Title=Rallying the Troops
TutorialScreen_StorageBuilding_01=Stockyards are used to store large amounts of raw materials.
TutorialScreen_StorageBuilding_02=Storehouses can store a variety of goods, including food, but are not well-equipped for preserving perishables over longer periods.
TutorialScreen_StorageBuilding_03=Root Cellars are for storing food items, keeping them fresh for a much longer period of time.
TutorialScreen_StorageBuilding_Title=Storage Buildings
TutorialScreen_StructuralIntegrity_01=     Building materials wear out over time and must be replaced. When the structural integrity of a building becomes dangerously low, maintenance must be performed. This process requires some of the same resources required to construct the building in the first place.[BR]     Once materials are supplied, builders automatically take care of maintenance requests. Increasing the number of builders can speed up this process if your settlement has a high number of damaged buildings. It is a good idea to gradually increase your builder allotment as your population grows.[BR]     If structural integrity is allowed to get too low, either because no builders or resources are available to perform repairs, the building will become condemned and will no longer function. In time, a condemned structure will collapse and become rubble that must be rebuilt in order for the building to function again.
TutorialScreen_StructuralIntegrity_Title=Structural Integrity
TutorialScreen_TownBell_01=     More than just the heart of the town, the Town Center acts as a formidable defense on its own. When there is an attack, you can press the bell button to rally the villagers to seek shelter inside.[BR]     While there is not room for all, those that are inside will fire arrows at nearby enemies. This can often be enough to take down lesser threats, such as wolves or a bear, but a Town Center cannot take on entire raids on its own.
TutorialScreen_TownBell_Title=Sound the Alarm
TutorialScreen_WorkAreas_01=     Some buildings have a work area in order to function. This circle defines where villagers will seek resources in the world. For example, a Hunter Cabin’s work area defines where a hunter will go to seek out game to hunt. A Fishing Shack’s work area defines what coastline a fisherman will fish from.[BR]     By default, a work area is centered on the structure, but that is likely not the best setup. To relocate a work area, Left-Click the Work Area button and then move the cursor to the desired location. The tooltip will give you insight into the resources within the work area before you confirm placement.[BR]     Setting work areas properly can help improve the efficiency of a building.
TutorialScreen_WorkAreas_Title=Work Areas
TutorialScreen_Wounded_01=When engaging in combat, villagers can sometimes be mortally wounded. If left without treatment, they will succumb to their injuries.
TutorialScreen_Wounded_02=If a healer is available, other villagers will automatically take any wounded villager(s) back to the Healer's House for emergency treatment.
TutorialScreen_Wounded_03=In order to heal a villager wounded in combat, you need a Healer's House with an employed healer.
